This project, ML_ESP32, is designed to leverage advanced machine learning models for the accurate prediction of core body temperature. It integrates seamlessly with an ESP32 microcontroller, which acts as the central processing unit for gathering crucial sensor data. These sensors include those measuring skin temperature, ambient temperature, heart rate, and weight. The combination of real-time sensor inputs and user-provided data such as age, height, pregnancy condition, and gender allows the system to generate precise predictions.

The operational flow begins with the ESP32 gathering data from the sensors, which are strategically placed to capture vital physiological metrics. Skin temperature sensors track variations in surface temperature, while ambient temperature sensors monitor environmental conditions. Simultaneously, heart rate sensors and weight sensors provide essential cardiovascular and body mass data, respectively.

User interaction is integral to the system's functionality. Users manually input data like age, height, pregnancy condition, and gender, providing essential contextual information that enhances the accuracy of temperature predictions. This hybrid approach, combining sensor data with user-specific inputs, ensures a personalized and robust prediction model tailored to individual health profiles.

Once the data collection phase is complete, the ESP32 processes this information using machine learning algorithms specifically trained for temperature prediction. These algorithms analyze the complex interplay between sensor readings and user inputs to compute an estimated core body temperature.

The culmination of this process is the display of the predicted core body temperature on a screen connected to the ESP32. This real-time feedback mechanism allows users to monitor their physiological state conveniently and proactively.

In essence, ML_ESP32 represents a sophisticated integration of IoT (Internet of Things) technology with machine learning capabilities, aimed at enhancing health monitoring through accurate and accessible temperature predictions. By harnessing the power of sensors and advanced algorithms, this project exemplifies the intersection of biomedical engineering and digital innovation, promising significant advancements in personal health management and wellness monitoring.
